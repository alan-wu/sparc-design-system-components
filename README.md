# SPARC Design system components

![Node.js Package](https://github.com/nih-sparc/sparc-design-system-components/workflows/Node.js%20Package/badge.svg)

## About

This design system serves a variety of audiences, and will be most useful in the Abstract format (a repository for designer files) to Developers/Engineers, and then to Designers.
To make it accessible to the DRC as a whole, and to share the importance of a consistent user experience, we have added explanatory text to the majority of pages; demonstrating utility of individual components.

As development becomes shared across the Cores, we recommend each Core's engineers refer to this design system, when creating new feature/functionality which will be highlighted on Sparc.Science.

Our intention is to create an online resource with the code for these components, and to update this quarterly.
