# About Breadcrumbs

A “breadcrumb” (or “breadcrumb trail”) is a type of secondary navigation which reveals the user’s location in a  Web application. Just like in the Hansel and Gretel tale, breadcrumbs in real-world applications offer users a way to trace the path back to their original landing point.

## Format

Breadcrumbs are the same on all breakpoints

<Story name='Primary' height='60px'>{stories.Primary()}</Story>

## Layout / Arrangement

Breadcrumbs are the same on all breakpoints

All breadcrumbs should use Title Case and have a character limit of 32 (with spaces). If the page is more than 32 characters then it is truncated and “…” is added.

Truncation should occur at the end of a word and not part way through a word.

<Story name='Layout' height='60px'>{stories.Layout()}</Story>
