# Introduction

This design system serves a variety of audiences, and will be most useful in the Abstract format (a repository for designer files) to Developers/Engineers, and then to Designers.

To make it accessible to the DRC as a whole, and to share the importance of a consistent user experience, we have added explanatory text to the majority of pages; demonstrating utility of individual components.

As development becomes shared across the Cores, we recommend each Core's engineers refer to this design system, when creating new feature/functionality which will be highlighted on Sparc.Science.

Our intention is to create an online resource with the code for these components, and to update this quarterly.

Qian Chen (GazelleCX) and Annelise Smith (Blackfynn) collaborated on this design system, and we will continue to work together to maintain the integrity of the system over time.

If you have suggestions, comments or questions, please send to support@gazellecx.com, or reach out directly to me at ellen@gazellecx.com.
