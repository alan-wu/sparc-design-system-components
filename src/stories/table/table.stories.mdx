# Table

Good data table designs allow users to scan, analyze, compare, filter, sort, and manipulate information to derive insights and clearly commit actions .

As GazelleCX completes a broader content strategy and analysis, it is likely that these tables will be optimized to address the relevant linkages between connected content to provide a richer faceted browse experience.

When the table content is too wide for the container, the information will scroll to the right.

## Table

<Story name='Primary' height='60px'>{stories.Primary()}</Story>

## Table (default HTML table or rendered by markdown)

<Story name='HTML Table' height='60px'>{stories.HTMLTable()}</Story>
